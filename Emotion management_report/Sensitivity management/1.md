Being sensitive is about not assuming u know everything already but instead to use your senses to redetermine what is real wither through enquirer or direct observation.
Sometimes we may feel people are being insensitive. This is unfortunately common, however responding to insensitivity with insensitivity is not necessarily justified.

Being sensitive is also about emotion and allowing another or yourself to explore an emotion to understand it. In understanding emotions we build narratives and strategies relating to them.

Insanity comes from a lack of sympathy.
